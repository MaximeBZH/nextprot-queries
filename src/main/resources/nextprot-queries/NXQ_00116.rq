SELECT  distinct ?entry  ?roi  WHERE {
 ?entry :isoform ?iso.
  ?iso :modifiedResidue ?ptm;:sequence ?s.
  ?ptm :term cv:PTM-0255;:start ?pos. # Example for phosphotyrosine
  ?s :chain ?chain;:length ?len.
  BIND (6 as ?width) . # The window size
  BIND (if (?pos>?width && ?pos<=?len-?width ,substr(?chain, ?pos-?width, 2*?width+1),"---") as ?roi)
  FILTER(?pos>?width && ?pos<=?len-?width)
}
order by ?entry

# The filter strangely has to be put after the BIND because even if put before the virtuoso engine will execute it after and crash the BINDing.
# This is why the BIND itself is in a 'if' clause which prevent crash, the "---" values are filtered out by the final FILTER
